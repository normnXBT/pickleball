simple team organization py script by Chat GPT-3 - 12 players, 10 rounds of 2v2, no two players can play on the same team twice during any round.
Version 4 latest working version. Successfully overcame problem:

"There are 12 players playing a sport. They want to play 10 rounds. Each team consists of two random players and rounds consist of 1 team vs 1 team. No two players can play twice of the same team. If it is not possible for a pool of 12 players to play ten two versus two rounds without two players playing on the same team twice, please notify me. If it is possible, please create a python script that will generate a list of a possible 10 rounds and the players on each team. If it is possible, I would like it to be displayed in this format:

Round n - (Player n + Player n) vs. (Player n + Player n)"

Version 5 was an attempt to fine tune the code, by asking chat to ensure all players play an aproxximately equal number of times, and it was also asked to add a check to the results ensure that no two players were playing on the same team at any time before it printed them. It was unsuccessful.
